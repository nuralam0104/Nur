I boost the ranking of my client's websites using established, ethical search engine optimization (SEO) methods. My approach to elevating your position in search results starts with optimizing your site's content, as it contributes roughly half of your ranking. The remaining factors include acquiring backlinks (links from other sites), refining on-page technical SEO, and enhancing overall user engagement.


I start with new clients by identifying the key terms that hold the most value for them and are likely to yield the greatest returns. We then assess the level of involvement required to attain rankings for these terms before devising a strategic plan.


Our strategy for attaining the top search result is straightforward: we win over Google. By adhering to all of Google's preferences, we enjoy the benefits.


In the realm of SEO, the level of competition may vary, yet it always presents an opportunity akin to an open-book exam. We can meticulously scrutinize rival websites and subsequently strategize our actions to surpass them.


Once we've pinpointed the search terms that offer the most potential, we implement a content strategy tailored to each of these queries. The content will aim to surpass competitors in ranking, featuring optimal length and keyword density. It will encompass the most suitable main topic, subtopics, and language to align seamlessly with Google's algorithm.


Eye-catching websites may be visually appealing, but they often fail to distinguish themselves. It's the websites that meet Google's algorithmic criteria that rise to the top, attracting leads and customers in the process.


I specialize in optimizing websites to enhance visibility, whether it's in your neighborhood or on a global scale. A finely-tuned website operates tirelessly, ensuring your business is always in the spotlight while you rest easy.


I offer continuous SEO support to various clients, ranging from a nationwide compression socks label and an internet title search enterprise to e-commerce ventures spanning diverse sectors, a legal firm based in Houston, mental health clinics, and numerous others. Additionally, I cater to smaller businesses like Master Tree Service, Greenville, a local tree care company in my hometown of Greenville, SC. I treat all clients equally, prioritizing tangible outcomes for their businesses over mere rankings or metrics.



After earning my bachelor's degree in Marketing and Management from Old Dominion University (Go Big Blue!), I honed my skills in sales for five years while mastering the intricacies of SEO, before ultimately launching my business full-time at the outset of 2020.


I'm keen to collaborate with you to enhance your website's ranking and boost the organic traffic it receives. Contact me today for any SEO requirements or inquiries you may have.
